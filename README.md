# PortfolioWebsite
I created this website using the VSCode IDE as a portfolio to display projects that I have created. The CSS style sheet and JavaScript logic can be found within the src file and are labelled styles.css and app.js, respectively.  
  
  If you have any questions about this website or the source code you can reach out to me at bainesdeal@gmail.com, or you can finde me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/baines-deal/
